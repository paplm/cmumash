<h2>Backgound</h2>

CMU is the biggest university in northern of Thailand

but i found a way to get the pictures of all students in the univesity since CMU start,

if you watched The Social network movie, the way to get  pictures is such like Mark get pictures from his house website(i swear, i found this way before i watch the movie)

let's i explain

CMU have a website that have information of all students include students images
so they keep pictures in public folder of site, file named as student id sush as 551234567.jpg , and now i got all images easily with a line of command

<p>curl -fO http://mis.cmu.ac.th/cmumis/images/student/[0-550000000].jpg </p>

with in six hour

<h2>What i want to do with this</h2>
